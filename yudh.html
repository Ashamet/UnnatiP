<h1>Rama and Ravana fought a fierce battle with bow and arrows for nearly seven days.
Ravana's chariot's flag-staff was brought down by Rama's arrows. Every time that Rama
 cut off Ravana's head, another head would crop up in its place. 
Soon after that came the fierce and a prolonged chariot-duel between the prince of
 Ayodhya and the king of Lanka. It was o intense a duel that it shook all the worlds and 
frightened all people. It is said that when the human-form Lord Rama and demon Ravana
 engaged in a battle, it was so out of the world that fr a while both their respective
 armies stopped duelling and stood watching the two fight.
The Lankan army of demons and Rama's huge army of monkeys fired not an arrow and stood
 without moving and held on to their weapons but eyes depicting wonder and hearts impressed.
Ravana was by no means a pushover. He fought valiantly even as Rama's confidence of victory
 was overwhelming. Ravana then fired his arrows in the direction of the flagstaff fixed on
 Rama's chariot. But see the miracle. None of his arrows could reach the Indra's chariot that
 Rama rode on. All of Ravana's arrows fell to the ground.
Rama's arrows, however, tore asunder Ravana's flag-staff that then fell and entered the earth.
 Absolutely beside himself with rage, Ravana now showered a stream of arrows and also took aim 
at the horses that pulled Rama's chariot.
But those were no ordinary horses, they neither stumbled not stopped. This enraged Ravana further.
 Now he rained a number of objects in the direction of Rama's chariot. That included gadaa (maces),
 hathora (iron bludgeons), chakras (discs), mountains and uprooted trees, axes etc.
When that failed, it was arrows, (astra) missiles and magic that he showered next. Ravana tried covering
 the sky with his missiles. 
It is said that Ravana saw his impending death, Rama could see victory alone. 
Now Ravana turned his attention to Matali, Indra's charioteer. But Ravana's attack and arrows could not
 hurt Matali even a bit.
That attack on Matali angered Rama. As Rama and Ravana battled on, the entire earth, including mountains,
 groves and forests trembled. The sun too became gloomy and shone less brightly upon Earth and the wind stopped moving.
The Gods in Heaven, the Gandharvas and the Kinnaras - all prayed: "May all be well with the cows and Brahmanas,
 May all the worlds endure forever, May Rama conquer Ravana!"
Vigilant and relentless, Rama chopped off Ravana's head, only to see it grow back. 
"What is the reason, these arrows by which Mareecha, Khara, Dushana, Kabandha in Kroucha-forest, and Viradha
 in Dandaka-forest were killed, by which seven Sala trees and the mountains were burst, by which Vali was killed and
 the ocean shaken up all these arrows which provided immediate succour to me in battle, have proved of little efficacy
 in the case of Ravana."
Finally, Matali, Rama's charioteer suggests that "To kill Ravana you must use the dreaded arrow of Brahma, given to you
 by Agastya Muni (sage/rishi), which never misses its target". So Rama shot the divine arrow, which had the power of the 
gods in it. 
This arrow found its mark and pierced Ravana in the heart, finally killing him.  </h1>
