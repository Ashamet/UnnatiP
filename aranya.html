<h1>When Lord Rama along with Sita and Lakshmana reached the forest, they had to cross the 
River Ganga. Guha (the king of Shrungabheripura), who had heard about Rama‚Äôs banishment, 
came running to help him. He asked one of his boatmen, Kevat to take them to the other side 
of Ganga. Kevat did namaskaar to the divine personalities and politely asked them to sit in
 his boat. He washed Lord Rama‚Äôs feet before letting him sit in his boat. After washing 
the feet, he ferried them across the river. Impressed by his services, Sita asked Lord Rama
 to give a ring of hers to Kevat. But he refused to accept it saying they both (Lord Rama 
and Kevat) do the same work. Kevat then explained his intention of not accepting the ring to
 Lord Rama. Overwhelmed by his gesture, Lord Rama blessed him with redemption of life and 
death granted Muktai to him.Shurpanakha, the sister of Ravana (King of Lanka), who was roaming
 around in the forest, besotted by Lord Rama‚Äôs good looks. But he declined her advances
 saying he is loyal to his wife Sita. She then approached to Lakshmana but got the same reply 
from him as well.Feeling insulted, Shurpanakha attacked Sita.After getting rejection from Lord
 Rama and Lakshmana, angry Shurpanakha attacked Mother Sita. Lakshmana quickly came into action 
and thwarted her. He then cut off her nose and sent her back to Lanka, the Kingdom of Ravana.Maricha,
 the Rakshasa (demon), was an ally of Ravana. Ravana sent him to Lord Rama's shelter with a
 wrong intention (in order to kidnap Sita). Maricha assumed the form of a golden deer and roamed around
 the shelter.Mesmerized by the beauty of the golden deer, Sita asked Lord Rama to catch him and bring 
him to her. Rama first disapproved Sita‚Äôs proposal but later agreed. He then went away to catch the 
golden deer for Sita.Lord Rama went to catch the golden deer (Maricha) but sensed something tricky about 
the deer. He fired an arrow towards the deer, which brought it to death.Just before dying, Maricha regained 
his original avatar of Rakshasa (demon) and started crying louder in the voice of Lord Rama. Sita got worried
 after listening her husband‚Äôs voice and asked Lakshmana to enquire what happened to his elder brother.
 Lakshmana was sure that no one can defeat his brother and said the same to Sita. But she said sarcastic
 words to him and forced him to go to save Lord Rama. At last, he went but drew a line, popularly known
 as Lakshmana Rekha outside their shelter in the jungle and requested Sita not to cross it.As Lakshmana
 departed and travelled some distance, Ravana, who was hiding in the woods, changed his appearance and
 came in disguise of an old ‚ÄòSadhu‚Äô (holy person). He asked Sita to give him some food and as soon as
 she went inside to get food for him, he tried to enter the shelter but could'nt do so as Lakshmana drew a 
line there before leaving. He then pleaded Sita to come outside and give him food. She first resisted coming 
outside but he scared her of giving curse to her husband Rama if she did'nt cross the line.
 Worried Sita agreed to fulfill his demand and crossed the line.ita crossed the line and Ravana took his actual 
avatar and left his disguise as theòSadhu. He picked Sita and said You belong to me nowù. 
He carried Sita away and kidnapped her.Jatayu, an old vulture bird saw Ravana kidnapping Sita.
 He didn't think twice and flew off into the sky to fight Ravana and save mother Sita. He gave a tough fight
 to Ravana but couldn‚Äôt last long and ultimately got killed by Ravana. 
The demon chopped his wings and limbs and he fell down dying.  </h1>
