<h1>One day while adjusting his crown king Dashratha noticed grey hair and this is when
 he decided it was time to give Rama all his stately duties. It was not because he was
 the eldest son but it was due to his capability, that Dashratha wanted Rama to be his
 successor. He sought sage Vashishthaâ€™s opinion on the same, who agreed that Rama 
should be made the king of Ayodhya. Prince Rama, the son of queen Kaushalya,
 had won the hearts of all the people because of his loving nature. 
The king sent a formal statement to the people of Ayodhya who were happy to see
 their favourite prince as the new king.it was queen Kaikeyi's maid Manthara who was not so happy.
 She asked Kaikeyi to staunchly oppose the decision and instead ask for her son's
 Bharata coronation. The queen didn't pay heed to her words and said Bharata can rule
 after Ayodhya after Rama. Manthra convinced her that the throne belonged to Bharata and 
not Rama. This made Kaikeyi fell into the trap of power hunger in the name of her son's welfare.
Manthra reminded Kaikeyi of the two boons the king had granted her when she saved his life in battle.
 The maid told her it was the perfect time to ask for them. It was her who advised Kaikeyi to lie in her
 room and wear soiled clothes and no ornaments. The queen did the same and weeped in anger when King Dahsratha came.
 The king tried to console her. As per the instructions of Manthra, Kaikeyi asked for her two boons. 
Kaikeyi demanded that Bharata should be made the king while Rama should be exiled into the wilderness
 for a period of fourteen years. The king was taken aback by her words and pleaded her to ask for something else. 
He was heartbroken but had no choice as he had to honour the promises made to her. He 
acceded to Kaikeyi's demands but was not able to face his son Rama. 
Queen Kaikeyi told Rama about his father's decree.Prince Rama agreed to fulfil his father's promise and decided to go
 into banishment in the forest. The news spread like fire and instead of celebration, doom persisted everywhere.
 Rama's wife Sita and brother Lakshmana accompanied him to the 14-year exile in the
 forest.King Dashratha was unable to bear the pain and passed away. The king lost conscious while recalling the curse by
 Shravan's blind parents,  whom he had killed mistakenly.Bharat refused to benefit from any of his mother's
 wicked scheming and decided to convince Rama to come back and take his rightful throne.Rama being the dutiful
 and obedient son refused to return to Ayodhya and decided to fulfil his father's
 last wish. Unable to persuade his brother to return to Ayodhya, Bharata took back Ramaâ€™s sandals and agreed to
 govern Ayodhya, not as its ruler,
 but as Ramâs representative.  </h1>
