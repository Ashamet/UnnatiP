<h1>The Ramayana teaches us that not only is it possible, but it is also necessary to ensure victory over evil forces.
 Lord Ram is the epitome of kindness, compassion, and love. His wisdom and patience made it possible for him
 to follow his inner good without worrying about the loss of luxuries and kingship.
 A person should always have a noble heart and good values.As a husband, he was duty bound towards his wife.
 But as a King, he had to think of his subjects wishes ahead of his personal ones.
Remain humble no matter how powerful you become.</h1>
