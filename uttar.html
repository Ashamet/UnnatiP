<h1>After Lanka, Sri Ram returns to Ayodhya in Pushpak Viman triumphantly,
 He escorted by Sita, Laxman, Sugriva, Hanuman and scores of hismonkeys,
People of Ayodhya awaited for the arrival of their future King breathlessly,
 Hanuman his messenger, pass the news that Sri Ram approaches finally.
People of Ayodhya lined on both sides to see their beloved Sri Ram lovingly,
 Kul-Guru Vashishta, Bharat, Shatrughna, 3 mothers greeted them happily,
 Grand function marked return of Ram, Sita, Laxman with soldiers monkey,
So started festival of lights – Diwali just honouring this great event solely.
Vashishta performed ceremonial rituals, crowning Ram, Ayodhya King finally,
 Six months passed joyfully and all the monkeys forgot their worldly duties.
 Ram reminded them and with heavy heart all departed from Ayodhya glumly,
`Ram Rajya’ engulfed Ayodhya with justice, morality and her people happy.
 In due course of time Sita gave birth to two sons named Lava and Kush,
This chapter of Ramcharitmanas is called Uttar Kand which means actually,
It not part of Ramayan or about life and works of Lord Sri Ram – be the story,
 It of Lord Shiva and Parvati’s life, Kagbhsundi’s life and previous births mostly.  </h1>
