<h1>King Dashratha, the ruler of Ayodhya was childless and quite upset about it.
 He organised 'Ashwamedha Yagna' with a desire to have a son. Agni, the god of fire 
presented the king with a son-giving divine dessert and told him to give the same to
 his three wives Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra. All his three wives consumed the
 dessert and after some time the king was blessed with four sons. Kaushalya gave birth
 to Rama while Bharata was born to Kaikeyi. Sumitra gave birth to 
twins-Lakshmana and Shatrughana.King Janak the ruler of Mithila, was ploughing a field
 one day and this is when Sita appeared splitting the earth. The king discovered the
 girl child lying in a deep furrow. She was found covered with soil and dirt. He was 
overjoyed seeing her and declared her as his own child. Janak considered the baby girl as 
a gift from mother earth and named her Sita. He along with his wife Sunaina raised Sita, who
 grew into a beautiful woman.Sage Vashistha acted as the teacher for the four princes in their
 childhood and taught them important skills. When Rama was 16 years old, Vishwamitra visted the
 court of King Dashratha and asked him to give Rama and Lakshmana to help him fight the demons.
 The demons were creating problems for the sages by ruining their yagnas. Dashratha was intially 
worried but on insistence of Vashistha agreed to Vishwamitra's request. It was sage Vishwamitra
 who imparted knowledge and instruction about supernatural weapons and warfare to the brothers. 
Rama and Lakshmana killed many demons including Ravana's relative Taadka with the help of this
 knowledge.Vishwamitra received an invitation from King Janak for his daughter Sita's swayamvar.
 The sage asked both Rama and Lakshman to accompany him to Mithila. Janak had raised the condition 
that whosoever will be able to tie the string of Shiva's bow will end up marrying his daughter.
 Many known warriors including Ravana attempted to do so but even failed in moving the bow. It was
 Lord Rama who was able to lift the bow. The bow broke into two pieces while Rama was tying the string.
The breaking of the bow into two pieces made Pashurama angry and he came to the ceremony. It was Lord
 Rama who was able to pacify the anger of Pashurama, who is Lord Vishnu's sixth avatar. Lord Rama
 married Sita in a grand ceremony on Vivaha Panchami conducted by Satananda. Rama's three brothers got
 married to Sita's sisters.  </h1>
